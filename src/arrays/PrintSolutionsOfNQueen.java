	 * The idea is to place queens one by one in different columns, starting from the leftmost column. When we place a queen in a column, 
	 * we check for clashes with already placed queens. In the current column, if we find a row for which there is no clash, 
	 * we mark this row and column as part of the solution. If we do not find such a row due to clashes then we backtrack and return false.
		1) Start in the leftmost column
		2) If all queens are placed
		    return true
		3) Try all rows in the current column.  Do following
		   for every tried row.
		    a) If the queen can be placed safely in this row
		       then mark this [row, column] as part of the 
		       solution and recursively check if placing  
		       queen here leads to a solution.
		    b) If placing queen in [row, column] leads to a
		       solution then return true.
		    c) If placing queen doesn't lead to a solution 
		       then unmark this [row, column] (Backtrack) 
		       and go to step (a) to try other rows.
		3) If all rows have been tried and nothing worked, 
		   return false to trigger backtracking.
		A modification is that we can find whether we have a previously placed queen in a column or in left diagonal or in right diagonal in O(1) time. 
		We can observe that 
		1)For all cells in a particular left diagonal , their row + col  = constant.
		2)For all cells in a particular right diagonal, their row – col + n – 1 = constant.
